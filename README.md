# Computer Vision CS-E4850 - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from the course **CS-E4850 - Computer Vision D** at **Aalto University**. Each exercise focuses on various aspects of computer vision, including image processing, feature extraction, machine learning applications in vision, and more.

The solutions are provided in various formats, including code and documentation, and aim to demonstrate the application of theoretical concepts discussed during the course.
